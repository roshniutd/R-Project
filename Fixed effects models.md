The data sets are available as tables in the wooldridge2.db file.
1 In the hprice1 table,We find the best model for the housing price using the AIC and BIC.
2 In the gpa2 table,we find the best model for the college GPA using the AIC and BIC.
3 In the mlb1 table, we find the best model that we can for salary using the AIC and BIC.
4 Using the rental table the data on rental prices and other variables for college towns are for
the years 1980 and 1990. The idea is to see whether a stronger presence of students affects rental rates. 
5 Using the state-level data on murder rates and executions in murder we consider the unobserved effects model
to see If past executions of convicted murderers have a deterrent effect
6 Using the data in airfare we are interested in estimating the model
ln(fareit) = i + dt + 1bmktshrit + 2 ln(distit) + 3[ln(distit)]2 + eit
where dt means that we allow for different year intercepts.
7 Using the data in loanapp for this exercise we estimate a logit model of approve on white.
8 Using the data set in ALCOHOL.RAW we analyze whether the effect of man abuses alcohol, and demographic and background
variables.
9 Refering to the data in fertil1 to estimate a linear model for kids, the number of children ever born to a
woman.
