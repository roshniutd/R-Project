Regression Analysis and plotting Correlation of various datasets using R

The data sets are available as tables in the wooldridge2.db file. 

1 The data in the wage1 table is analysed to record the CPI for wages in two different time series.
2 The data in meap01 table are for the state of Michigan in the year 2001. This data is analyzed to see if the expenditure or other factors of a functional school would be affecting student scores.
3 The data in 401k are a subset of data analyzed by Papke (1995) to study the relationship between participation
in a 401(k) pension plan and the generosity of the plan. The variable prate is the percentage of eligible
workers with an active account; this is the variable we would like to explain.
4 The data set in ceosal2 contains information on chief executive officers for U.S. corporations. We analyze the data to see the increase in wages given an increase in tenure
5 Using the data in wage2 we would estimate a simple regression explaining monthly salary (wage) in terms of IQ score
(IQ).
6 Using the meap93 data, we want to explore the relationship between the math pass rate (math10) and spending
per student (expend).
7 Using the data in hprice1 to estimate the model for a specific data range
8 The file ceosal2 contains data on 177 chief executive officers and can be used to examine the effects of firm
performance on CEO salary.
9 Using the data in attend I created the variable atndrte which is attend/32 because there were
32 classes to do further analysis.
10 The data set htv includes information on wages, education, parents education, and several other variables for 1, 230 working men in 1991.We estimate the effect of other variables on this model and plot the results
